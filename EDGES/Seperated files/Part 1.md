*PART I — SEEING THE HUMAN ANIMAL*

1. **“We study animals as if we’re not one of them — that’s why we miss the most obvious truths.”**
2. **“Most people don’t think; they just feel in patterns and call it thinking.”**
3. **“To understand someone, watch not what they say they value, but what they repeat without noticing.”**
4. **“Every human is an ecosystem of instincts, habits, and justifications — the trick is seeing which part is running the show.”**
5. **“If you strip away the language and the posture, we’re just another animal trying to feel safe and significant.”**
