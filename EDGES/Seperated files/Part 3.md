*PART III — STRATEGIC PRESENCE (Greene-style positioning in social life)*

1. **“You’re never just present — you’re either positioned or exposed.”**
2. **“The loudest person is rarely the most powerful, but often the most disposable.”**
3. **“Invisibility is a weapon when it’s chosen, a weakness when it’s forced.”**
4. **“Influence is rarely taken; it’s given by those who think you can’t harm them.”**
5. **“Position yourself where you can’t be ignored without being resented.”**
