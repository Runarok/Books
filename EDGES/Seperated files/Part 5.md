*PART V — LONG-TERM SELF-MASTERY (Closing the Loop)*

1. **“Discipline isn’t about control — it’s about building a life that runs without constant force.”**
2. **“Mastery is when the hard thing becomes the default thing.”**
3. **“Long-term wins come from short-term systems that don’t collapse under boredom.”**
4. **“Self-mastery isn’t a goal — it’s the maintenance cost of freedom.”**
5. **“The loop closes when you no longer need reminders to live the way you said you would.”**
