## Acknowledgements

Two books shaped how I think, act, and eventually — write.

The 48 Laws of Power by Robert Greene made me look at power differently. Not as something loud or obvious, but as something subtle — shaped by silence, timing, and perception. It’s not idealistic. It’s honest about how people behave, even when we wish they didn’t.

Atomic Habits by James Clear grounded me. It showed me that change isn’t a single moment — it’s a system. That consistency beats intensity. And that structure is often more powerful than motivation.

One taught me how people move.
The other taught me how to move with intent.

Both helped me live with more clarity — and pushed me toward writing something of my own. Not to compete, but to contribute. This book is part of that.
