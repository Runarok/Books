*PART II — BREAKING THE TRAPS (Psychology + Practical Strategy)*

1. **“Every trap is built on two things: what you want, and what you fear losing.”**
2. **“You don’t beat a trap by resisting it — you beat it by making it irrelevant.”**
3. **“The strongest chains are the ones you think are part of your body.”**
4. **“Most people don’t escape because escape feels unnatural — they mistake discomfort for danger.”**
5. **“The first step to freedom is insulting the trap enough to no longer want it.”**
