## *Acknowledgements*

> *“In a world full of traps, the errors you witness can become your sharpest tools.”*

I did not write this book because I was flooded with praise.  
Those who read my first work were few — but they read with attention, and that was enough.  

It gave me a sharper kind of happiness, the kind that does not depend on applause.  

Writing leaves me fuller than any quick victory can.  
It strengthens my belief that clarity is worth more than comfort, and with each book, I feel my own maturity sharpen.  

To the second — those caught in carelessness, in stagnation, in shortsighted games — you shaped this book more than you know.  
Not as examples to follow, but as reminders of the turns to avoid.  

From you, I learned the value of knowing what not to do, and how much strength can come from the mistakes we witness, not just the victories we admire.
