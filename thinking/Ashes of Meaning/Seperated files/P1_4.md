## **Borrowed Hours**

*Time was running long before you showed up. It keeps running after.*

The clock didn’t start when you were born. It was already in motion — long before your first breath, before your parents, before your name existed. Suns burned, mountains shifted, rivers carved their paths, galaxies spun silently in the dark. You arrived *into* motion, not at the beginning. You stepped into a current that never asked for you, and one day, you’ll be swept out of it just as quietly.

That’s the part we forget: the hours you call “yours” were never really yours. Time didn’t pause to greet you. It didn’t slow down to let you catch up. It doesn’t care who you are, what you want, or what you plan to do with it. It runs indifferent — steady, unbothered, endless. And one day, it will keep running without you.

### **The Hours That Aren’t Yours**

We talk about “spending time” like we own it — but we don’t. Not a single second belongs to you. You borrow each one, hold it briefly, then lose it forever. Every tick of the clock is a loan you can’t repay, a thread you don’t control.

The day you were born, the universe didn’t reset its clocks. No fresh counter started just for you. You were handed a slice cut from something infinite — a random allotment with no guarantee of how much you get. Some of us get decades. Some don’t. And none of us know how much is left in the jar.

### **The Quiet Theft**

Time is taking from you even when you’re not looking. Every hour you ignore is an hour you’ll never see again. Every breath spent is one less waiting for you. Every version of yourself — the child, the teenager, the person you were last week — is already gone, dissolved into memory without asking permission.

That’s the quiet cruelty of living: you keep disappearing in pieces. You shed identities, faces, moments, entire years, and yet you rarely notice until you look back. Time isn’t malicious. It isn’t merciful either. It simply moves forward, and you move with it whether you’re ready or not.

### **Before and After**

We spend most of our lives staring at our small stretch of years — this job, this love, this plan, this regret — as though this window is everything. But zoom out, and the scale makes you dizzy:

You are living inside a gap.
Everything before you is gone.
Everything after you, you’ll never see.

For billions of years, time rolled forward without you. For billions more, it will continue — long after your name is dust, long after everything you built collapses into the same silence. Oceans will vanish. Cities will sink. Even the sun will burn out, and time will still be running. And yet, somehow, you exist right now — in this thin, fragile slice of “now.”

### **The Only Thing You Get**

If that sounds bleak, maybe it isn’t. Maybe it’s the opposite. Because once you understand how little time is yours, you start holding it differently. The hours become sharper, heavier, more real when you realize they’re borrowed. You stop waiting for “later” because later is a gamble you were never promised.

You don’t own tomorrow.
You don’t own forever.
You only ever get *this* — the sliver of existence you’re standing in. Everything else keeps moving with or without you. But right now, the thread hasn’t snapped. The seconds are still here. The hours are still yours — for a little while longer.
