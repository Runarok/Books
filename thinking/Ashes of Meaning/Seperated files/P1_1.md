# **Finite Breath**

*You arrive without asking for it.*

Nobody asks you if you want to be here. One moment, you’re nothing — no body, no thoughts, no name, no memory of ever wanting to exist — and then, without warning, you’re thrown into the world. A scream, a breath, lights burning your unopened eyes. It begins before you even understand what “beginning” means. And none of it is yours to choose. Not your birth, not your body, not your parents, not the century you land in. You arrive in the middle of a story already moving, surrounded by rules you don’t understand and a language you don’t yet speak.

By the time you’re old enough to notice you’re alive, the world has already decided parts of you. Someone hands you a name before you know who you are. Someone tells you which gods to believe in, which dreams are worth chasing, which customs are sacred and which are forbidden. Even your first idea of yourself doesn’t come from you — it comes from mirrors, from other people’s words, from expectations you never agreed to carry. Yet nobody pauses to explain any of this. Life doesn’t wait for you to catch up. The moment you arrive, the clock is already running.

## **The Countdown Starts Early**

The first breath you take is already borrowed, and every inhale after that is part of a deal you never signed. The clock started ticking long before you even knew there was one. At first, you don’t notice it. Childhood shields you from the weight of passing time — days stretch endlessly, summers feel infinite, and you believe there will always be a “later.” But time doesn’t wait. Quietly, invisibly, it thins behind you while you’re busy learning what it means to live.

One day, you wake up and realize how much has already gone. People you knew are older now; some aren’t here anymore. Versions of you — old dreams, old selves, old identities — have disappeared too. And then it hits you: from the moment you arrived, you’ve been moving toward the exit. No one explains that the hours you’re spending don’t come back. You breathe out, and that breath is gone forever. The next one too. You’re trading your life second by second, whether you’re aware of it or not. And the strange part? You never even asked to play this game.

## **The Weight of Inheriting a Life**

Existing sounds simple until you’re the one doing it. Then you realize how much comes attached. You inherit responsibilities before you understand what responsibility even means. You inherit wounds you didn’t cause, expectations you didn’t agree to, debts and patterns passed down silently like invisible luggage. The people before you made choices — about survival, about belief, about family and freedom — and their consequences land in your hands before you’re old enough to know what to do with them.

You carry stories you didn’t live. You follow rules you never questioned. You act like you chose, but mostly, you’re reacting to things you were handed. And if you’re lucky, at some point, you wake up to this. You begin noticing how much of “you” was built before you even arrived. That’s when life gets heavier, because awareness has a cost. It forces you to wonder which parts of yourself are truly yours — and which were planted there by everyone else.

## **The Unasked Question**

Here’s the strange thing: nobody asks if you want to exist, but everyone demands that you justify it. Be good. Be useful. Be happy. Be someone. The list is endless, but the source is the same: you showed up here without consent, and now the world expects you to make something out of the time you didn’t choose to have.

Maybe that’s where the quiet tension of life begins — somewhere between gratitude and resentment. You didn’t ask for this breath, but it’s yours anyway. You didn’t choose this body, but you’re the one who has to live inside it. You didn’t set the clock, but you’re the one racing it. Nobody gives you answers. Nobody explains what it means to be alive, or why we’re here, or if there’s even a reason at all. You’re dropped in the middle of the story with one instruction: keep breathing.

## **Existing Anyway**

And maybe that’s the unsettling truth: you don’t control the beginning, and you won’t control the end. Yet between those two points — arrival and exit — you’re handed this thin thread of time. You can’t stop it from unraveling, but you can feel it slipping through your hands. That’s the only certainty you get.

Some people spend their whole lives trying to explain it. Some hide from it completely. Most just keep moving, hoping meaning will reveal itself somewhere along the way. But underneath all the noise, one fact stays steady: you didn’t ask to be here. And yet… you are. Breathing. Borrowing hours. Spending a life you didn’t choose, inside a world that doesn’t owe you explanations.
