**Preface**

Life doesn’t hand out instruction manuals. There’s no guide, no map, no one to tell you what it all means — or even if it means anything at all. We arrive unasked, unnamed, unprepared. And from that first breath, we are thrown into a world already in motion, carrying expectations, chaos, and invisible debts we never agreed to.

This book is not a promise of answers. It’s a quiet companion for noticing. Each piece you’ll read is a fragment — a moment of reflection, a pause in the noise, a way to look at life without pretending it’s neat or fair. It’s about observing the impermanence, the accidents, the illusions, the fleeting joys, and the quiet truths that exist between the chaos.

Here, you won’t find conclusions. You won’t find directions for happiness or certainty. You will find echoes of the experience you already know: that existence is strange, temporary, and profoundly fragile. And that sometimes, the only thing you can do is breathe, notice, and keep moving, even when the world offers no guarantees.

This is a book about being here anyway, about seeing clearly, and about letting the ashes of meaning fall without trying to hold onto them. Read slowly. Sit with the silence. Let it touch you.
