## **The Noise of Meaning**

*We invent purpose because silence feels heavy.*

Somewhere deep down, you already know. There isn’t a reason. Not really. The universe isn’t keeping score. It doesn’t whisper back when you ask *why*. And yet, we can’t sit inside that silence for long. We can’t stare at the emptiness and simply accept it. The quiet feels too heavy, too complete, and it presses in on us until we respond. So we start making noise — constructing explanations, creating obligations, inventing meaning. It’s the first defense against the crushing weight of nothing.

We need it because awareness without a story is unbearable. To feel alive, we need the world to have significance. And since it doesn’t, we make our own.

### **The Weight We Can’t Hold**

Sit in a completely silent room for a while — no phone, no music, no one else around. At first, the quiet is soothing, almost meditative. But after a few minutes, it becomes uncomfortable. Thoughts start creeping in. Memories, worries, unspoken fears. That silence forces you to confront yourself, and suddenly, you feel too small in a vast, indifferent universe.

We’re not built to exist in raw stillness. We need edges, anchors, narratives to cling to. Religion, morality, ambition, love, identity — all of these systems are scaffolds we build to avoid the suffocating emptiness. They give us structure, comfort, and something to lean on, even if they aren’t absolute truths. They don’t stop the universe from being indifferent; they stop *us* from unraveling under it.

### **Filling the Quiet With Purpose**

We convince ourselves we are here to make a difference, to leave a mark, to love, to create, to be remembered. These stories aren’t lies. They are the mechanisms we use to navigate the world without breaking under its indifference. Purpose becomes our flashlight in a dark room — not because it illuminates truth, but because it illuminates *enough* to keep moving.

Without this constructed noise, life feels like a hollow repetition of breaths, a fragile body orbiting a star that doesn’t notice. Every moment we spend striving, every small act of meaning we choose, is an act of survival — an assertion that, at least for now, we refuse to be swallowed by silence.

### **The Stories We Build to Save Ourselves**

Every civilization does this. Gods written into the sky, afterlives promised, destinies etched into myths, entire cultures organized around grand narratives. Even science is a kind of story — a way to make sense of chaos, to create patterns where there are none. The universe doesn’t owe us meaning; we construct it because we cannot exist without it.

We are storytellers first, meaning-makers by necessity. We build our identities, values, and lives around narratives that give the chaos a shape we can manage. And yet, the truth remains: the scaffolds don’t last. What holds you today may crumble tomorrow. That doesn’t make your efforts meaningless; it just underscores that meaning is temporary, built to hold you upright long enough to keep walking.

### **But the Noise Doesn’t Last**

Even the things we pour our lives into eventually fade. Beliefs that once demanded devotion can feel hollow decades later. Loves, ambitions, careers, entire identities dissolve with time, rewritten by new experiences or forgotten altogether. Civilization itself, with its battles, discoveries, and faiths, erodes into history, leaving traces but rarely permanence.

This impermanence doesn’t make our creations worthless. It makes them human. We don’t invent meaning to capture eternity; we invent it so we can stand up in the morning without collapsing into despair. The scaffolding may not last, but it holds long enough to let us continue breathing, acting, loving, and choosing.

### **A Softer Truth**

You don’t have to fix the silence. You don’t have to outsmart it, outrun it, or conquer it. Meaning doesn’t need to last forever to matter. Your reasons don’t need to be universal to be real. If purpose is noise, let it be noise. Let it fill the room for now, let it give you something to hold onto, let it carry you through uncertainty.

Perhaps the point was never to escape the silence at all. Perhaps the point was only to make enough sound — enough story, enough effort, enough presence — to feel alive while it lasts. That’s enough. That is what it means to survive in a world that doesn’t promise meaning, and yet to create it anyway.
