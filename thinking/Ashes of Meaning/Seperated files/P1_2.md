## **Unasked, Unnamed**

*Your name comes before you know who you are.*

Before you know you exist, someone decides what to call you.

It’s the first thing the world gives you — a sound, a label, an identity small enough to fit on paper. They write it down, speak it aloud, pass it around. That name enters rooms before you do, introducing you to people you’ve never met. Strangers learn to say it before you even learn to form words. People use it like they already know something about you, as if syllables alone can carry the weight of who you are.

But in those first years, you don’t know what it means. You don’t even know what *you* mean. At first, it’s just noise — a sound you’re trained to respond to. Over time, the sound sticks. It becomes yours, but not because you chose it. That’s the first quiet trick of life: pieces of your identity arrive fully decided, long before you’re old enough to question any of it.

### **The Weight of a Name**

A name sounds simple, but it carries more than you think.

Someone chose it for a reason — maybe after a grandparent, a god, a memory, or a dream they once had for you. Sometimes it’s tied to history, sometimes to hope, sometimes to nothing more than a sound they liked. But whatever meaning it holds for them, it arrives as baggage for you. You inherit it without consent, without context, without knowing the stories it carries.

Your name folds you into a family you didn’t choose, a culture you didn’t design, a timeline you didn’t start. And slowly, other people begin attaching meaning to it. They decide what someone *with your name* should be like, what kind of person you must become. Expectations start stacking up quietly, invisibly. By the time you can even spell the letters, the world has already decided pieces of you.

### **The First Version of You**

Before you understand yourself, you’re living inside other people’s definitions.

You grow up hearing words they think describe you:
“You’re clever.”
“You’re stubborn.”
“You’re shy.”
“You’re trouble.”

Sometimes they mean well, sometimes they don’t — but either way, those words sink in. They become shortcuts for identity, small fragments you start stitching into a version of yourself. Without realizing it, you begin wearing their descriptions like clothes you never picked out.

And then one day, you catch your reflection and wonder why the person staring back feels unfamiliar. That’s when the quiet fracture begins — the space between the *given* identity and the *chosen* one.

### **The Trap Nobody Mentions**

Here’s the part nobody warns you about: even if you change your name later, you can’t escape it completely.

It shapes the earliest version of you. It carries the weight of memories, associations, and expectations tied to those letters and sounds. You can rewrite your story, but you can’t rewrite the years when the world told you who you were supposed to be. That shaping runs deep, woven into how people remember you — and sometimes, into how you remember yourself.

And names are only the beginning. The voice you speak in, the language you dream in, the beliefs handed down like heirlooms — all of it arrives before you know how to choose. Before you ever meet yourself, you meet their version of you.

### **Unlearning the Given**

If you’re paying attention, there comes a moment when you start peeling those layers back.

You begin asking harder questions:
“Who would I be without my name?”
“Who would I be without their expectations?”
“Who am I when nobody’s watching?”

These are unsettling questions because they pull at the foundations you’ve stood on your entire life. Most people avoid them. But if you stay with them, something shifts. You start seeing your name for what it is: a label, not a prophecy. A story starter, not the entire plot. You may not get to choose the sound the world calls you by, but you get to decide the person who turns their head when they hear it.

### **Finding What’s Beneath**

You arrive unnamed. Someone else decides the first word the world knows you by. And for a long time, that word carries more power than it should. But beneath it — beneath every syllable, every story, every expectation handed to you — there’s something untouched.

Something unshaped.
Something quieter.
Something still yours to discover.

That’s where you begin.
