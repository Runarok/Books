## **Chasing Permanence**

*Trying to hold what time erases anyway.*

We live as if the world can be captured, frozen, and preserved. We cling to memories, achievements, relationships, and possessions, believing they can anchor us against the tide of time. But everything slips. Every moment fades, every person changes, every accomplishment is eventually forgotten. Permanence is an illusion, yet we pursue it relentlessly, as though holding on could cheat the inevitable.

It’s a quiet tragedy and a human necessity at the same time. We build routines, take photographs, write letters, and craft legacies — each an attempt to declare: “I was here, and I mattered.” Even knowing the futility, the act of chasing permanence gives our fleeting lives a sense of weight, of importance, of continuity.

### **The Illusion of Holding On**

You store memories in photos and journals, hoping they will keep the past alive. You hold onto people, fearing the emptiness that comes when they leave. You chase achievements, convinced they will secure a place in the world that survives your absence.

Time does not respect these attempts. Photos yellow, letters decay, memories blur, and the people we cling to drift away. Even achievements fade in significance as the world moves on. The very act of trying to hold on highlights the impermanence we deny, a reminder that permanence is never granted, only imagined.

### **The Weight of Temporary**

Clinging to what will vanish is exhausting. The energy spent on preserving what cannot last sometimes outweighs the joy of experiencing it. We measure our worth by what we can keep, not what we can feel or create in the moment.

And yet, there is a certain beauty in this struggle. The act of holding, even knowing it will fail, reminds us that life is precious precisely because it doesn’t last. Every laugh, every touch, every fleeting glance gains intensity when we acknowledge that it cannot endure. Temporary becomes valuable because it is temporary.

### **Finding Meaning in the Fade**

Perhaps the lesson isn’t in resisting the passage of time, but in embracing it. Memories can be cherished without expecting them to remain intact. Relationships can be savored without assuming permanence. Achievements can be celebrated even if they eventually dissolve into history.

Letting go doesn’t mean losing. It means understanding the rhythm of life: everything is in motion, everything will change, and everything is worth noticing while it exists. The pursuit of permanence may be futile, but in chasing it, we learn to live more fully in the present, to love more openly, and to appreciate what is fleeting before it slips away.

### **Acceptance as Freedom**

Acknowledging impermanence can be liberating. The weight of trying to hold the unholdable lifts when we accept that everything will eventually leave our grasp.

You cannot stop time, and you cannot freeze what is passing. But you can live in its motion, aware of its fragility, and fully present with the moments that do exist. In embracing impermanence, you find a kind of permanence in how deeply you inhabit life — even as everything around you continues to vanish.
