## **Erosion**

*Memory thins out. Names disappear. Nothing keeps its label.*

Time is a subtle thief. It doesn’t announce itself with alarms or sirens. It creeps quietly, dissolving edges, blurring details, letting yesterday fade like footprints in sand. Faces you knew intimately become shadows. Conversations once vivid become hazy impressions. The more years pass, the more familiar things slip into a quiet unrecognizable fog. Even the things you thought were permanent — names, places, people — eventually become abstract shapes in your mind.

The process is relentless, yet it is almost invisible until you stop and notice. A friend’s laughter you once remembered clearly now comes only as a fragment of sound. Your own childhood dreams feel like someone else’s story. Memories you swore you’d never forget vanish quietly, leaving gaps that nothing can fill. The erosion is impartial; it spares no one, no emotion, no significance.

### **The Weight of Forgetting**

Forgetting is heavier than you expect. It is not just memory that fades — it is identity. The version of you that knew a certain truth, loved a certain person, or believed a certain way gradually erodes until it no longer exists in the same form. The labels you once clung to — your name, your role, your achievements — lose their grip on reality. Even history, the stories you told yourself about who you are, starts to crumble under the quiet pressure of forgetting.

And it isn’t malicious. It’s simply the way the world unfolds. Life moves forward, and the past moves into abstraction. This thinning of memory can feel like loss, but it is also a kind of release. The sharper edges of regret and grief dull, and what remains is a softening — a space to breathe, to reinterpret, to inhabit the present without being weighed down by the full accumulation of what once was.

### **The Impermanence of Labels**

Names and titles, even identity itself, are temporary. They are useful tools while you exist, but they do not anchor reality. Someone you loved might be remembered differently by others, and in your own memory, they may shift every time you recall them. The person you were in one place at one time becomes impossible to fully retrieve.

This is both terrifying and liberating. Terrifying because nothing feels permanent. Liberating because you’re not trapped by the past. You can release, reinterpret, and redefine. What mattered then may not matter now, and that is part of being alive: constantly negotiating between what you remember, what you forget, and what you choose to carry forward.

### **Living with Erosion**

Acknowledging erosion is a practice of presence. You understand that every moment exists only briefly, that memory will not preserve it indefinitely. Instead of clinging, you learn to notice, to appreciate the fleeting clarity of people, experiences, and feelings while they are still tangible. The beauty isn’t in permanence; it’s in the act of witnessing, even as it slips away.

The world, and you within it, will fade. Names disappear, faces blur, and stories unravel. But for the brief time they exist in your mind, they hold weight, and that is enough. It is enough to live fully, to love fully, to act fully — even knowing the tide of forgetting will come for all of it.
