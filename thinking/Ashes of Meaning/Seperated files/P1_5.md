## **On Becoming Temporary**

*Every version of you eventually fades.*

You think of yourself as one person — one continuous “you” moving through time. But you’re not. You’re a collection of selves, each one appearing, changing, dissolving, without asking for permission.

The child you once were — gone.
The teenager — gone.
The person you were five years ago, or even last week — untraceable except in fragments.

And yet, you don’t notice the disappearing while it’s happening. You live inside each version thinking it’s permanent, until suddenly it isn’t. That’s the quiet truth we resist most: not only will you die someday — *pieces of you are dying all the time*.

### **Shedding Without Realizing**

Look back at old photos. You recognize the face, but the mind behind it feels foreign. The dreams you had then, the fears, the tiny obsessions — most of them don’t fit anymore. You can’t step back into who you were. That self is gone, even though you still carry its echoes everywhere you go.

This isn’t just growth; it’s erasure. Your brain forgets on purpose. Neural pathways weaken, memories dissolve, priorities shift. You’re built to let versions of yourself fade, because holding on to every self you’ve ever been would break you. You don’t just *change*. You *shed*. Quietly. Constantly.

### **The Weight of Impermanence**

It’s unsettling to realize how temporary even *you* are — not just your body, but your thoughts, your habits, your very sense of self. You keep assuming there’s a solid “you” beneath it all, something fixed, but look closely and it slips through your fingers.

One day, a single conversation changes how you see the world. One loss rearranges your values overnight. One chance encounter reshapes your idea of love, meaning, success — all the things you once swore were unshakable. You outgrow relationships, abandon beliefs, and leave behind entire worlds you once thought you’d never escape.

### **The Versions That Die Before You Do**

We like to think death comes once, at the end. But really, it happens in pieces, scattered across a lifetime.

Every time you outgrow a dream, that version of you dies.
Every time you stop loving someone you thought was forever, that version dies too.
Every belief you discard, every home you leave, every season you never return to — another quiet funeral.

You carry these ghosts without meaning to. Whole lives you’ve already lived, piled behind you like forgotten skins.

### **And Yet, You Keep Becoming**

But this isn’t just loss — it’s also motion. The selves you’ve left behind made space for the ones you are now, and the ones you haven’t met yet. Every ending has carved room for a beginning, even when you didn’t notice it happening.

You’re temporary, yes, but not finished. Right now, you’re becoming someone your current self can’t fully imagine. The choices you make today will one day feel like they belonged to a stranger. The person reading these words might not exist five years from now — and that’s its own strange, beautiful kind of freedom.

### **The Quiet Acceptance**

If every version of you fades, maybe the point isn’t to cling. Maybe it’s to notice. To be fully awake inside this version while it still exists.

Because this “you” — the one breathing, thinking, reading these words right now — is brief. Temporary. Borrowed like everything else. One day, someone will look at a photo of you and think, *that was who they were back then*. And by then, even this self — this exact moment of being — will already be gone.
