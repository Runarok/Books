# 📚 Books

This repository is for people who want to create books they enjoy — and want a **practical**, **real**, and **non-performative** process to follow.

It’s also for **myself** — I’m one of those people.

I use this repo to upload the books I create and to share the exact process I follow. If you're into making books based on topics you care about, this might be useful to you.

## 📁 Folder & File Overview

Each folder in the `/books` directory contains a single book project. There’s no strict format — each folder may include any of the following, depending on what I chose to make:

- **`.md` file** — The full book in Markdown format  
  *(e.g. `Modern_Magic.md`, `Life_Lessons.md`)*

- **`.pdf` files** — Typically, you'll find multiple versions:

  - `Book_Title.pdf` — A standard PDF for general reading
  - `Book_Title_Booklet.pdf` — A print-ready **booklet-style PDF** for folding/stapling
  - `Book_Title_Booklet_Separated_Cover.pdf` — Same as above, but with a **detached cover page** for printing on thicker paper or for binding

  **Recommended Print Settings:**
  - Print on both sides & Flip on long edge

## 🧠 Why I Do This

I have a lot of different interests. Making “content-books” is one way I enjoy organizing and sharing what I care about.

I'm not doing this professionally. I simply enjoy the process — writing helps me think, and turning thoughts into book form gives them a shape I can share.

I don’t aim to write in fancy or poetic ways. My style is simple, direct, and low on fluff — that’s how I think, and how I like to read. That’s the tone I stick to in all my books.

## 🌐 Book Site

📍 [Aurora Chronicles Website](https://tempestaethel.github.io/AuroraChronicles/)

This is where I publicly link to the books from this repo.

Note: You can't read the books directly on the site — it simply redirects to the appropriate GitHub folder for each book. It’s a clean way to browse and share.

## 🗣 Final Note

This isn’t a perfect author journey or polished writing portfolio.

It’s a space to **make and share real, readable books** around topics that matter to me — and maybe to you, too. If you're interested in casually building your own books, feel free to explore or use the same workflow.

More will be added over time, as interest and energy allow.
