# 📚 Books

This repository is for people who want to start making books they like — and want a **practical**, **real**, and **non-performative** process to follow.

It’s also for **myself** — I’m one of those people.
I use this repo to upload the books I create and share the exact process I follow. If you’re into making books based on topics you enjoy, this might be helpful.

## 📁 Folder & File Overview

Each folder contains one book project. There's no strict format — each folder **may include any of the following**, depending on what I chose to make:

* `.md` file — the complete book in markdown, named after the book (e.g. `Modern_Magic.md`, `Life_Lessons.md`).
* `.pdf` files — usually two versions, both named after the book:

  * A **regular PDF** for basic reading.
  * A **booklet PDF** designed for printing.
    * **Print settings**:
      * Print on both sides
      * Flip on long edge
* A folder called `Separated files/`:

  * Contains `.md` files split by sections or topics.
  * Used when building GitHub Pages versions (updated at my own pace, not always present).

**You might see only one `.md` or just PDFs, or all of the above. It depends on what I finished for that book.**

## 🧠 Why I Do This

I have a lot of different interests. Making “content-books” is one of them.

I’m not doing this professionally. I just enjoy making things based on what I care about, and putting them in a book form helps me process and share them.

I don’t write in fancy or poetic ways.
My writing style is simple, direct, and low on fluff — that’s how I think and how I like to read. So that’s the tone I aim for in these books.

## ⚙️ My Book-Making Process

I use AI — mainly ChatGPT — to help bring structure, polish, and expand on my core ideas.

Yes, people debate whether using AI for writing is “right.” But I believe if it’s used thoughtfully, it’s a powerful creative tool.

### My Steps:

1. **Customize ChatGPT to Fit My Style**

   * I feed GPT with detailed preferences:

     * Avoid fluff
     * Keep responses clear, minimal, and to the point
     * Don’t overwrite
   * I use either a Custom GPT or just a long, structured setup prompt.

2. **Start with Thinking — Don’t Skip That**

   * It’s tempting to ask GPT for ideas, but I strongly suggest **you think first**.
   * Overdependence makes your creative brain slow and passive. You’ll miss the value of original thinking.

3. **Then Use GPT to Expand & Improve**

   * Once I have a rough idea and book concept, I:

     * Break it down into key headers or themes
     * Provide full background to GPT
     * Ask it to help generate or improve content
   * I always revise what it gives. AI is support, not substitute.

## 🛠️ Print-Friendly Booklets

To make a booklet version of the PDF, I use this online tool:
👉 [https://online2pdf.com/en/create-a-booklet](https://online2pdf.com/en/create-a-booklet)

This helps turn a regular PDF into a print-ready booklet you can fold and staple.

**When printing:**

* Choose **Print on both sides**
* Use **Flip on long edge**

## 🌐 Book Site (Coming Soon)

I plan to upload final, nicely rendered versions of my books to a public website.
For now, this is just a placeholder.

## 🗣 Final Note

This isn't some perfect author journey or polished writing portfolio.
It’s a place to make and share real, readable books around topics I enjoy.

If you're into the idea of building your own books — even casually — feel free to look through these or use the flow I follow.
More will be added as I make them, based on time and interest.
