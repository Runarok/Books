# 📚 Books

This repository is for people who want to create books they enjoy — and want a **practical**, **real**, and **non-performative** process to follow.

It’s also for **myself** — I’m one of those people.

I use this repo to upload the books I create and to share the exact process I follow. If you're into making books based on topics you care about, this might be useful to you.

## 📁 Folder & File Overview

Books are organized into two main categories based on their focus and tone:

- `thinking/` — Books about structured ideas, personal philosophy, life systems, or societal critiques.  
  These focus on how we live, think, and interact — often from a practical or reflective perspective.

- `expression/` — Books centered around self-expression, emotion, and creative output.  
  This includes things like quote collections, emotional explorations, introspective prompts, or artistic fragments.

Each book folder **may include** a subfolder named **separated_files** containing modular Markdown files split into parts or chapters.  
This approach helps break down longer works into manageable pieces and supports building full books incrementally.

Every book folder within the main categories represents a single project. The contents can vary but typically include one or more of the following:

- **`.md` file** — The full book in Markdown format  
- **`.pdf` files** — Usually multiple formats:

  - `Book_Title.pdf` — Standard PDF for general reading  
  - `Book_Title_Booklet.pdf` — Print-ready booklet (fold & staple)  
  - `Book_Title_Booklet_Separated_Cover.pdf` — Booklet with a detached cover page for special printing

- **`separated_files/` folder (optional)** — Markdown files split into chapters or sections inside the book folder

**🖨️ Recommended Print Settings:**  
Print on both sides, flip on long edge.

## 📂 Assets Folder

The `assets/` folder contains supporting documents, guides, templates, and other extra files related to the book-making process, such as:

- 📘 [Book-Making Process](./assets/BOOK_PROCESS.md) — How I use thinking + AI to structure and create my books

- Other helpful resources and templates for writing, formatting, and publishing

## 🧠 Why I Do This

I have a lot of different interests. Making “content-books” is one way I enjoy organizing and sharing what I care about.

I'm not doing this professionally. I simply enjoy the process — writing helps me think, and turning thoughts into book form gives them a shape I can share.

I don’t aim to write in fancy or poetic ways. My style is simple, direct, and low on fluff — that’s how I think, and how I like to read. That’s the tone I stick to in all my books.

## 🌐 Book Site

📍 [Aurora Chronicles Website](https://tempestaethel.github.io/AuroraChronicles/)

This is a simple front-end that links to each book using the structured data in `Books.json` at the root of the repository.

> Note: You can't read the books directly on the site — it redirects to the correct GitHub folder for each book. It’s a clean way to browse and share.

## 🗣 Final Note

This isn’t a perfect author journey or polished writing portfolio.

It’s a space to **make and share real, readable books** around topics that matter to me — and maybe to you, too. If you're interested in casually building your own books, feel free to explore or use the same workflow.

More will be added over time, as interest and energy allow.
