## ⚙️ My Book-Making Process

I use AI — mainly ChatGPT — to help bring structure, polish, and expand on my core ideas.

Yes, people debate whether using AI for writing is “right.” But I believe if it’s used thoughtfully, it’s a powerful creative tool.

### My Steps:

1. **Customize ChatGPT to Fit My Style**

   * I feed GPT with detailed preferences:

     * Avoid fluff
     * Keep responses clear, minimal, and to the point
     * Don’t overwrite
   * I use either a Custom GPT or just a long, structured setup prompt.

2. **Start with Thinking — Don’t Skip That**

   * It’s tempting to ask GPT for ideas, but I strongly suggest **you think first**.
   * Overdependence makes your creative brain slow and passive. You’ll miss the value of original thinking.

3. **Then Use GPT to Expand & Improve**

   * Once I have a rough idea and book concept, I:

     * Break it down into key headers or themes
     * Provide full background to GPT
     * Ask it to help generate or improve content
   * I always revise what it gives. AI is support, not substitute.
