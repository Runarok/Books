## 🛠️ Print-Friendly Booklets

To make a booklet version of the PDF, I use this online tool:
👉 [https://online2pdf.com/en/create-a-booklet](https://online2pdf.com/en/create-a-booklet)

This helps turn a regular PDF into a print-ready booklet you can fold and staple.

**When printing:**

* Choose **Print on both sides**
* Use **Flip on long edge**
