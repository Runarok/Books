## 🛠️ How to Create a Print-Friendly Booklet from a PDF

This guide walks you through converting any regular PDF into a folded, stapled booklet that prints properly — with clean covers, correct page order, and blank pages where needed.

* **Flip on long edge**

These settings ensure the pages align correctly when folded.

### 📄 Step 3: Ensure Total Pages = Multiple of 4

To print as a proper booklet, your final PDF must have **a total number of pages that’s a multiple of 4** (e.g., 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28...).

Why?
Booklets are printed 4 pages per folded sheet (2 on front, 2 on back). If your PDF isn't a multiple of 4, blank pages will be needed to fill the space.

**How to fix this:**

* Use this tool to add blank pages:

### 🎨 Optional: Add a Separate Cover Look

If you want the first and last pages to act as a proper cover (possibly on thicker paper), follow this format:

1. **Add a blank page after the first page**
   → This becomes the inside front cover.

2. **Add a blank page before the last page**
   → This becomes the inside back cover.

3. Check total pages again:

   * Still needs to be a multiple of 4.
   * If not, add 1–3 extra blank pages **before the final cover** (last page).
   * These pages can serve as “notes” pages or just filler.

### 📝 Example

**Original PDF:** 27 pages
**Goal:** Make it booklet-ready

* Add 1 blank page → now 28 pages ✅
* For cover effect:

  * Add a blank after page 1 → becomes page 2
  * Add a blank before the last page → becomes second-to-last
* Now at 30 pages
* Add 2 more blank pages before the last page to reach 32 ✅ (clean layout + bonus note pages)
