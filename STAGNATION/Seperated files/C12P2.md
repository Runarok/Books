#### **Definition**

Purpose fatigue occurs when sustained effort toward goals or meaningful work leads to exhaustion, disillusionment, or reduced engagement. Reinvention is the deliberate practice of adjusting or redefining your purpose to sustain energy, relevance, and alignment.

> **Meaning:** Instead of abandoning meaning, adapt your approach, focus, or method to maintain forward momentum without sacrificing well-being.

#### **How It Manifests**

* **Emotional burnout:** Feeling drained despite working toward meaningful goals.
* **Loss of motivation:** Passion fades as routine or pressure outweighs intrinsic drive.
* **Rigid identity attachment:** Over-identification with a single purpose prevents flexibility.
* **Reduced creativity:** Fatigue stifles problem-solving and innovation.
* **Frustration with outcomes:** Effort seems disproportionate to results, leading to discouragement.

#### **Origins**

* **Sustained high demand:** Long-term projects, responsibilities, or social impact work can be emotionally and mentally taxing.
* **Perfectionism or overcommitment:** Holding oneself to rigid standards magnifies fatigue.
* **External pressure:** Expectations from society, peers, or self can intensify strain.
* **Lack of reflection:** Continuing without evaluating alignment or method leads to cumulative exhaustion.
* **Identity fixation:** Believing purpose must remain fixed prevents adaptive evolution.

#### **Consequences if Ignored**

* **Chronic burnout:** Fatigue deepens, affecting productivity, health, and relationships.
* **Stagnation in impact:** Inability to innovate or contribute meaningfully.
* **Disillusionment:** Work feels futile, eroding motivation and self-efficacy.
* **Missed evolution:** Opportunities for refining purpose or methods are lost.
