## Preface

You want a preface? Fine. Here it is: nothing happens. That’s the whole point.

You’re waiting for the first spark, the first push, the “here’s where it starts.” But stagnation doesn’t start. It just stays.

I’ve seen it in different shapes — in friends who couldn’t move on, in strangers who spoke of waiting years for change, in the quiet pauses people carry without naming them.

This book isn’t my story alone. It’s pieces I’ve learned from listening, watching, asking. Each page is a reflection of someone’s standstill — not as failure, but as a moment that shaped them.

I don’t have answers. I’m just laying out what I’ve gathered, hoping that in these fragments you might see your own standstill differently.

Sometimes learning from the weight others carried makes our own feel lighter.

So turn the page, not because this will move you — but because movement begins by refusing to stay on the same one.
